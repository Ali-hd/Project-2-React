### Technical Used

Reactjs

API

javascript

### User Stories

As a user I want to choose to search for a specific recipe.
As a user I want to see the intructions on how to make that recipe.
As a user I want to watch a video on how to make it.
As a user I want to search by categorie.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

I used the console.log() throughout the code, whenever I needed to check the outcome of a variable at a particular time. Also when I find a problem in my code I read the code line by line slowly to see if something doesn't make sense.

### Unsolved problems

Going to a link directly without clicking buttons on the page may result in an error since that page wouldn't know where the data is coming from.

### Favorite functions

My favorite function is being able to seperate my code inside components and dealing with each component alone.
